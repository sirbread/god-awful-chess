# god-awful-chess
a game of chess where the pieces are scrambled and you'd hate me if you play it

## Setup
To run the game, you need to have **Stockfish** (the chess engine) installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Stockfish**:
   - *Direct* Download: [Stockfish Latest Release](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/latest/download/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.zip)
   
2. **Unzip the Stockfish file** and **rename the executable**:
   - After downloading, unzip the file.
   - Copy the `stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe` executable from the unzipped folder into the same directory as `main_release.py` and the `assets` folder.
   - *Rename* the Stockfish executable file to `stockfish.exe`.

Once you have Stockfish set up, youâ€™re ready to go!

## Play
1. After the setup is complete, simply run `main_release.py`.
2. A difficulty slider (from 1 to 20) will appear for you to select how hard the AI will play (20 being impossible to beat).
3. Once you select your desired difficulty, the game will start. But it's all scrabled up...

## Enjoy! (or not)
For your convenience, I've managed to cram everything into one long file...this took way too long
