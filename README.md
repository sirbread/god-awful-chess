# god-awful-chess
chess, but it's something you'd never wanna play

# setup
In order for any parts of the game to work, you must download Stockfish. <br>
Link [Direct Download]:  <br>
https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/latest/download/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.zip
Once you have downloaded, unzip the file, copy "stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2" to the same directory as "main_release.py", and *rename it it stockfish.exe*. 

#play
Now that you've got stockfish set up, simply run "main-release.py", select your difficulty (1-20, whereas 20 is impossible to beat), and play normal chess, but all the pieces are scrabmled up.

*Enjoy!*
